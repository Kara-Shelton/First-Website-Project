        <h2>What is CrossFit?</h2>
        <p>We are a community of diverse individuals with a similar goal in mind... work hard every day. We have high-level professional athletes, beginners, adults, children, adaptive division, and masters (age group). There truly is a place for everyone, and all are welcome. A typical day at a CrossFit gym would be back-to-back classes coached by some of the best coaches in the country. Physical ability is often measured by mobility, and that is a major focus at our gym. We are not as concerned with how much a person lifts, but whether or not they lift well. Health, happiness, and longevity are key goals at CrossFit Weddington. We teach you how to train your body for the long haul. Come in and be prepared to work. You may have to force yourself into these doors, but we are confident you will not regret it.</p>

        <h2>Class Structure</h2>
        <p>CrossFit Weddington hosts a wide range of classes at multiple times throughout the day. We try to offer as many classes as possible, so you are sure to find at least one slot that works with your schedule. Each week, we have classes from 0500 - 1200 in the mornings. Then we have an early afternoon break, and start back up with our two afternoon classes at 4:30, 5:30. Then, we have our specialty classes at 6:30 pm. You can find more information about the specialty classes by highlighting over the day in the widget below. We hope you will make time to come and say hello. If you have been looking for a sign to change your life, consider this to be it. We look forward to having you join our family.</p>

        <img id="coryPic" src="CoryBW.png" alt="founderPic">
        <p id="CoryBio">My background in massage therapy and functional fitness has helped me have the opportunity to work with several professional teams including the Volvo Cannondale Professional Mountain Bike Team, the Schwinn Toyota Professional Mountain Bike Team, the French National Team for Motocross Des Nations in Brazil, and several professional Motocross racers including: Jeremy McGrath (AMA Supercross Champion), Jimmy Button, Sebastian Tortelli (FIM World Champion), Ernesto Fonseca (East Coast 125 Champion), Buddy Antunez (Arenacross Champion), and Ryan Hughes. My interest in functional fitness, and peak performance led me to a natural progression to CrossFit in which I was certified in 2008. You can find me often on our gym floor training everyone from our beginning athletes to professional athletes, and everyone in between.

            When I am not coaching, my favorite thing is spending time with my wife and three children. They are the most important things in my life.
