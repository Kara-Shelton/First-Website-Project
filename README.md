# First-Website-Project
CrossFit Weddington Demo Site (for desktop browser).
This was a website build for an Intro to Web-based Applications and Design. This website was designed to be viewed on desktop browsers, preferably Chrome.
The website was created with expressed permission from CrossFit Weddington owner, Cory Worf. Any use of this code without permission is considered a violation of
Copyright laws.

There were specific objectives for the site in order to receive a passing grade. All requirements were met, and the grade received was an A.
If you would like more information about the requirements, please feel free to send me a DM on Discord ka1r0#9086
